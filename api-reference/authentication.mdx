## Base URL

The Staytion base URL is built on REST principles. We enforce HTTPS in every request to improve data security, integrity, and privacy. The base URL does not support HTTP.

<Info>Base URL `https://api.gostaytion.com`</Info>

## Authentication

The Staytion API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys in the [Staytion dashboard](https://partner.gostaytion.com).

Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure! Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.

<Tip>
  Your `secret` API key should never be public, shared or exposed in a github
  repository.
